With the skills I developed in this course I want to give a recommendation about the top venues in each district so tourist can visit them.\n\nWe will give tourist a top 5 of venues in each district where they can experiment different things. We know that tourist whenever travels to a location, he tries to find best spots around in that specific location to explore. In order to give good recommendations we will use the Foursquare API to get the venues of each district and finally recommend tourist a district, with venues where he can visit.\n\nBogot\u00e1 is Colombia\u2019s sprawling, high-altitude capital. Bogot\u00e1 has many cultural venues including museums, art galleries, library networks, stage theaters, sports and attraction parks and its a city where cousine is really important, the restaurants across the city is the prove of that, there are many restaurants that serve typical and international food.\n\nNote: For this problem we will use the data provided by bogota-laburbano.opendatasoft.com andFoursquare to get the geographical coordinates of each district and the venues."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.

Bogota city is divided in 20 districts: 19 urban and one rural. Many of them are the oldest towns in Colombia. Each district is conformed by a group of \"UPZ\" (Unidades de Planeamiento Zonal) and each UPZ is subdivided in neighborhoods. In this analysis we will explore the districts, to get the geographical coordinates of the districts we download the csv file of this site:\n    \n    Link: https://bogota-laburbano.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/georeferencia-puntual-por-localidad/table/\n    \n    \n2.
